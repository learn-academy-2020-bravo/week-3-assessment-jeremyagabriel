# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Declaring a nested object key as a variable that can be used/accessed in shorthand form

  Researched answer: Destructuring on objects lets you bind variables to different properties of an object.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: Value, Index, (original) Array

  Researched answer:
  - the value of the element
  - the index of the element
  - the Array object being traversed



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for objects and cannot actually be accessed/invoked on its own. An object can be an instance of class and thus can be accessed/invoked/etc.

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects. An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class. A class is used to bind data as well as methods together as a single unit.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: An HTML div is a general divider tag for elements, while span is used immediately within HTML string/copy to target specific words/elements.

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to ha



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: In React, the render method of each component can only return one node, so every JSX element you want to render needs to be nested within one tag. Instead of nesting all these elements in a single div tag, React.Fragment is used instead and eliminates the extra node that would have been created with a div tag.

  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Use the @media CSS to adjust the CSS of the page and its elements at different viewing sizes, or instead of using a set pixel amount use percentages. Use Bootstrap, which makes your page responsive for you. Use flexbox so elements wrap down when viewing sizes decrease.

  Researched answer: CSS3 Media queries. jQuery. Bootstrap



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb - IRB stands for "Interactive Ruby." It's a Ruby shell or REPL. REPL stands for read–eval–print loop. It is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes user inputs (such as, in our case, snippets of Ruby code), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. IRB is run by your computer's terminal.
- Instance variable - In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance.
- Ruby hash - Unlike arrays which are mere lists, Hashes are like dictionaries, storing other objects. You can use them to look up one thing by another thing.
- Class relationships - Three important relationships in Ruby are known as ‘belongs to…’, ‘has many…’, and “has many of each other”. The ‘belongs to’ and ‘has many’ relationships are considered to be the inverse of one another.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby - Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
